* work with branches (public / private)
* —Åollective blogging
* create / edit / delete posts
* enable / disable comments
* add (after owner confirmation) / edit / delete comments
* language selection (english, russian, ukrainian)

#### Collective blog use
#### To use blog more than one person you need:
* in own repo enter settings
* choose ` Collaborators`
* in the field enter name of user, whom you granted access
* press the button`Add collaborator`

### Possible problems
#### Problems updating blog
Propably you are working with blog out of platform.
To work blog correctly all changes should be done by platform interface.
If you have reasons not to use interface of platform, then you need:
* set up webhook:
  * in your repo enter settings
  * choose menu add Webhooks
  * in field Payload url insert http://gitblog.pythonanywhere.com/git_username/git_repo_name/api/web_hook, where git_username  is the name of your account GitHub, and git_repo_name is repo name
  * in content type choose application/json
  * Just the push event and Active should be marked
  * final stage - Add Webhook
* or update blog by button Update

#### impossible to add comments
In forked repo there is no opportunity to add comments. 
You should use your own repo
